# Current Line Character Count

A simple Obsidian plugin that displays the character count of the current line in the status bar.

## Features

*   **Real-time Count:** Shows the character count of the line where your cursor is currently located.
*   **Status Bar Integration:** Integrates seamlessly into Obsidian's status bar for a non-intrusive display.
*   **Dynamic Update:** Updates instantly as you type or move your cursor to different lines.

## Usage

Once the plugin is enabled, simply open any Markdown file in your Obsidian vault. The character count for the line your cursor is on will automatically appear in the bottom-right corner of the Obsidian window (in the status bar).
